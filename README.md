This project was created as part of my second semester coursework.  
The main focus was on **responsive web design**, **visual aesthetics**, and **clean structure**, using only **pure HTML and CSS** — no frameworks.

##  Project Description

**Adobe Basics** is a static, educational-style website inspired by Adobe’s product family.  
It introduces the basic features and tools of popular Adobe applications through a visually appealing layout.  
The primary goal of the project was to demonstrate:
- the ability to build a structured and elegant web layout,
- responsive design adaptation across multiple screen sizes,
- and consistent color, typography, and spacing systems.

##  Responsiveness

The design maintains a clean structure up to **1536px width**, with partial adjustments for **1024px tablets**.  
Although some elements may overlap at smaller breakpoints, it does not affect usability or core functionality.  

The layout was tested on:
- **Desktop browsers:** Chrome, Edge, Firefox  
- **Tablet (simulated 1024px):** Partial alignment preserved  
- **Mobile:** Fully optimized
